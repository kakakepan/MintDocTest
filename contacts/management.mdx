# CONTACT HANDLE

A contact handle, also known as a handle ID, is a unique identifier assigned to a contact within the contact management system of **"Super Reseller dashboard"**. It serves as a reference or key that helps identify and distinguish individual contacts or organizations.  Contact handles are crucial for maintaining contact information, ensuring uniqueness across different contacts, and facilitating efficient retrieval and management of contact records within a system.

Contact handles are typically generated according to specific logic or rules, such as incorporating the first characters of a contact's name or company name, along with a unique numeric value. Below is a generic table illustrating the logic use by **"Super Reseller"** for generating the **"Handle Id"** when creating a new contact:

| Is Organization | First Name | Last Name | Company | Handle Id |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------- |
| No              | Chris      | Matthew   |         | P-JD00001 |
| Yes             |            |           | Walmart | O-AM00001 |
| No              | Kane       | Perry     |         | P-JS00002 |
| No              | John       | Anderson  |         | P-MJ00003 |
| Yes             |            |           | Target  | O-GO00002 |

The **"Handle Id" **in the table above is generated based on the provided logic:

- There are two types of contact types for the **"Handle Id"** i.e. organization and non-organization.
- The **"Is Organization" **parameter indicates if a contact is categorized as an organization or not, with "yes" for organization and "no" for non-organization.
- For non-organization contacts, the **"Handle Id"** format is P-WW##### (P: Prefix, W: First Name Initial, W: Last Name Initial, #: Numeric Character).
- For organization contacts, the **"Handle Id"** format is O-WW##### (O: Prefix, W: First Two Letters of Company Name, #: Numeric Character).
