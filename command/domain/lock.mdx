**"Transfer Lock"** is a command that is implemented on a domain name to prevent unauthorized or accidental transfers of the domain to another registrar. It is a security measure designed to protect the ownership and control of a domain name. Within the domain details in the **"SuperReseller Dashboard"**, there exists a specific field named **"Transfer Lock,"** which encompasses two distinct values **"Yes"** or **"No"** specified as under in the table:

| Transfer Lock Values | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Yes"**            | When set to **"Yes,"** it restricts the reseller from modifying the contacts associated with the domain. |
| **"No"**             | When set to **"No,"** it grants the reseller the ability to update the domain's contacts as necessary.   |
