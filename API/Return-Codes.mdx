Within the **"API Integration"** option, the "**Return Codes"**  in the API of **"Register.domains"** refer to the status codes or response codes that are returned by the API after making a request. These codes provide information about the outcome of the API request and help developers understand the result of their operation. Each return code corresponds to a specific status or condition, indicating whether the request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action. By analyzing the return codes, developers can handle the API responses effectively, troubleshoot issues, and ensure proper integration and functionality within their **"Register.domains"** system.
