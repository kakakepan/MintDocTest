Registration Policy refers to the predetermined rules or guidelines governing the timing and duration of domain registration. It determines when a domain registration will expire and how it will be renewed. The Registration Policy field in the domain portfolio displays the selected policy option using a corresponding ID. To enhance clarity and user understanding, we have replaced the ID numbers with their respective text values in the domain portfolio.

The following are the text values associated with each ID:

| Value | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Normal              | This policy sets the domain registration to expire based on the regular renewal cycle determined by the registry or registrar. |
| Minus one day       | With this policy, the domain registration expires one day before the regular renewal date. |
| Minus one week      | The domain registration expires one week before the regular renewal date. |
| Minus one month     | This policy causes the domain registration to expire one month prior to the regular renewal date. |
| Minus two months    | The domain registration expires two months before the regular renewal date. |
| Set to December 31  | With this policy, the domain registration is set to expire on December 31 of the corresponding year, regardless of the regular renewal date. |

By displaying the text values instead of the ID numbers in the domain portfolio, users can easily identify and understand the specific registration policy applied to each domain. This information plays a crucial role in managing domain registration and renewal processes, ensuring compliance with the chosen policy and avoiding unintentional lapses in domain ownership.

## Examples

To provide a better understanding of how the Registration Policy affects the Expiration Date, here are some examples:

1. The .com extension has a **"Registration Policy"** of Normal. For instance, a .com domain registered on 6-15-2022 for 1 year would have an Expiration Date of 6-15-2023.
2. The .com.ar extension has a **"Registration Policy"** of Minus one day. If a .com.ar domain is registered on 6-15-2022 for 2 years, the Expiration Date would be 6-14-2024.
3. The .com.cy extension has a **"Registration Policy"** of Set to December 31. For example, if a .com.cy domain is registered on 6-15-2022 for 1 year, the Expiration Date would be set to 12-31-2022.
