Superseller dashboard provide additional extension field settings that provide more control over domain registration and renewal.

The purpose of each field is as follows:

1. **Registration Period**: This field allows specifying the duration for which a domain can be registered. It determines the available options for the "Years" field in the domain registration form. The registration period is defined as an interval, represented by a dash ("-"), indicating the minimum and maximum number of years allowed for registration. For example, "1-10 years" means the domain can be registered for any duration between 1 and 10 years. Some extensions may have specific registration period options.

2. **Renewal Period**: This field defines the duration for which a domain can be renewed. It specifies the available renewal options when extending the registration period for an existing domain.

3. **Grace Period**: The grace period is the additional time provided after the domain's expiration date during which the domain can still be renewed without incurring any penalties or losing ownership. It allows domain owners a grace period to renew their domains before they enter the redemption period.

4. **Redemption Period**: The redemption period is a period following the grace period during which the expired domain can still be redeemed. During this time, the domain owner can typically restore the domain by paying a redemption fee in addition to the renewal fee.

5. **Explicit Renewal Always**: This feature ensures that explicit renewal is always required to extend the domain registration. It prevents automatic renewal and prompts the domain owner to actively confirm the renewal.
