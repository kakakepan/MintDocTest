## Importan Things to Consider
- The **"Registration Period"** field represents the maximum number of years a domain can be renewed.
- The domain's expiration year is determined by the **"Registration Period"** value.
- If a reseller orders a domain for the maximum number of years, it cannot be renewed until the following year.
- Before accepting a **"RenewDomain"** command, the system should check the domain's expiration year and the maximum value of **"Registration Period."**
- If the number of years specified in the **"RenewDomain"** command exceeds the maximum supported value, display an error message stating that the command cannot be executed due to exceeding the maximum registration years for the extension.
- Extensions with "**Explicit Renewal Always"** set to **"No"** have an additional restriction.
- Domains belonging to these extensions can only be renewed within 30 days of the **"Domain Expiration"** date.
- If a user attempts to renew before the 30-day window, display an error message stating that the command cannot be executed because the renewal window opens 30 days before domain expiration.
- When dealing with a domain in **"Expired - Recoverable"** status:
- If the expiration date plus the **"Grace Period"** has not yet been reached, accept the renewal normally.
- If the expiration date plus the **"Grace Period"** has already been reached, display a window message to the user.
- The message should inform the user that the renewal date for the domain has passed but it can still be renewed with a late renewal fee for domain redemption.
- The message should also specify the amount of the late renewal fee (e.g., $XX).

## Special Status: Expired - Recoverable
In certain cases, when a user attempts to renew a domain with the status "Expired - Recoverable," two scenarios may arise based on the calculation involving the "Expiration Date" and the "Grace Period":

### Scenario 1
If the expiration date plus the **"Grace Period"** results in a date that has not yet been reached, the renewal process can proceed in the regular manner. The user can renew the domain without any additional considerations.

### Scenario 2
If the expiration date plus the **"Grace Period"** has already passed, a window message will appear to the user, displaying the following text:

**The Renewal Date for this domain has already passed**

You can still renew the domain; however, please note that there is a late renewal fee for domain redemption.

Alongside this message, the user will be presented with two options:

- **Accept late renewal fee**: This option allows the user to proceed with the renewal request, acknowledging the late renewal fee for domain redemption.
- **Cancel renewal**: This option enables the user to cancel the renewal request without incurring any additional fees.

Only if the user accepts the late renewal fee by clicking the "Accept late renewal fee" button, the domain renewal request will be created and processed accordingly.

This approach ensures that users are informed about the late renewal fee associated with domains that have reached their expiration date plus the grace period. By providing clear instructions and options, users can make informed decisions regarding the renewal of domains in the "Expired - Recoverable" status.
