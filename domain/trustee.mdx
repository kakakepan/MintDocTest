If you are unable to meet these requirements, **"SuperReseller"** provides the Trustee Service to fulfill the residency requirement, When the Trustee Service is enabled for a domain, it is marked in the domain portfolio with the field **"Trustee = Yes,"** indicating that the service will be charged during domain renewal.
