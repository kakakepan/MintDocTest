The **"ccTLDs"** feature within the **"Knowledge Base"** option describes country code top-level domain (ccTLD) which is a two-letter Internet top-level domain (TLD) specifically designated for a particular country or territory by explaining their relevant **" Action"**, **"Extension"** , **"Country"**, **"Continent"**, **"Trustee"**, **"Private Registration"**, **"Requirements"**, and **"IDN"**. These ccTLDs are country-specific top-level domains primarily used to facilitate identifying and localizing websites associated with a specific country or geographical region. They are managed by **"Register.domains"** and serve to establish an online presence associated with a particular country or territory.
