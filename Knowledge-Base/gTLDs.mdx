The **"gTLDs"** feature within the **"Knowledge Base"** option, known as Generic top-level domains (gTLDs) are a category of top-level domains that are not specific to any country or region. They are designed to serve as global identifiers for websites, regardless of their geographical location. Unlike ccTLDs, which are two-letter country-specific codes, gTLDs consist of three or more letters. They are categorized by their relevant **" Action"**, **"Extension"** , **"Category"**,, **"Trustee"**, **"Private Registration"**, **"Requirements"**, and **"IDN"**. The introduction of new gTLDs in recent years has expanded the options available, offering more specific and niche-focused domain extensions by providing a versatile and flexible naming system, allowing website owners to choose a domain that aligns with their industry, purpose, or brand.
