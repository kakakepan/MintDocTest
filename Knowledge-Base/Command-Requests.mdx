**"Command requests"** for **"Register.domains"** refer to the actions taken by users through execution commands, such as **"RegisterDomain"**, to request the registration of a domain name. These requests are initiated either through an API or an online webform. Each command request generates a unique **"Request ID"** that serves as a tracking identifier for that specific registration command. Command requests related to domain registration can have different **"Request Statuses" **to provide information on the progress and outcome of the request. These statuses include:

| Status     | Description                            |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------- |
| In Process | The request is being executed.         |
| Successful | The request was successfully executed. |
| Cancelled  | The request was cancelled.             |

By monitoring the **"Request ID"** and its associated **"Status"**, users can effectively track and manage the progress of their domain registration requests. Additionally, **"request logs"** are available for review, providing a comprehensive record of command requests and their respective statuses.
