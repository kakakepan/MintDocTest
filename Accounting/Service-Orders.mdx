Within the **"Accounting"** option, the "**Service orders"** feature captures the details of the domain services requested by clients, including the scope of the service, the anticipated duration, and any additional terms or requirements agreed upon. These orders serve as the foundation for the subsequent invoicing process, as they provide a clear record of the domain services to be provided to the clients. By documenting these details accurately, service orders facilitate proper communication, ensure alignment between the **"Register.domains"** and the client's expectations, and serve as a reference point throughout the service delivery process.
